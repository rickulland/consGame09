consGame will be an engine for on and offline video games. It provides a map and default functions that let one walk through an incredibly boring game doing nothing important. Actions descibed as 'default' become the base interface for your game wad, which you can ignore to add interesting parts  in manageable chunks. 

That code isn't available yet. Instead 'consTrek' is both the engine code and test wad. So it serves two masters and is not especially good at either task. It actually runs, so we can exersize ideas using a default display. And it actually crashes, go we're getting bugs squashed. 

Plus it's easier to describe specifics than explore possibilities. So read Treks manual before you read this one first.

Once it's debugged, we'll rip out all the Trek stuff and release a proper engine.
